Calculating the rotation of an helix relative to another domain. Script deals with the fitting, works with two chains and hardcoded for CAP variables. It will be generalized on an unforseen day. 

The angle calculated is between two principal axes. First one is the principal axes of the reference structure helix. Second one belongs to the simulation. The movement analyzed is between these axes within xy plane if the structure is fitted to the z axis. 

**WARNING!** I haven't thought much about how I calculated this one, since it was written not for my own project, but to a researcher in need as a starting point.
