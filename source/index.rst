Welcome to STB ProteinArt's documentation!
===========================================

	The biggest challange for a biologist or an experimentalist in computational biology field is the lack of "computational" knowledge. There are many tools out there, yet there are many times you need to write your own script. The scripts collected in this github repo are the product of those needs. They were written specifically for pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. With some modification they are applicable to any membrane protein. The future releases will cover this issue. 

	You will realise quickly, I do not have the programmer's discipline. The scripts here have no proper comments or markups. Well not yet anyways. But I hope to change that and adapt better ways of coding and this repo is my first attempt. If you are a newby in computational biology on the other hand, I hope you will find these scripts inspirational and realise that this field is fun and not scary at all. Afterall I am one who did not touch a computer before 2004. I also did not magically start coding right away. My proper introduction to the terminal was not until 2009. You see it is doable to make the change and learn to use the terminal or programming as long as you have the interest. The hard part is to be disciplined, writing codes that are for general use with documentations, creating test sets and catching errors. Maintaining this repo will help me exactly at this point. Opening the doors to my secret codes, I force myself to think from the users perspectives and improve my work.

	Some of these scripts are based on Samuel Murails work (like setting up GLIC simulations), some are written entirely by me. You can reach the scripts from the `git repo <https://github.com/ozyo/stb_proteinart>`_

	So enjoy the site. Suggestions are welcomed (contact: ozgeyoluk_at_proteinart.net).
