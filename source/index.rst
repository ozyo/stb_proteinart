Welcome to STB ProteinArt's documentation!
===========================================

	As a traitor to biology field I have found the meaning of life in doing molecular dynamics simulations. It feels a bit like playing a vidoe game with one big exception. You most certainly do not have a game controller. You are the creator of the video game, you'll code. Your code will come to life. But during the development stage it will look nothing like a video game. 

	As a traitor to biology field I often find myself in front of a big giant rock in computational biophysics field (computational biology, biophysics, etc. etc.). You need to defeat that rock, turn it into sand just with your thoughts. You should be able to come up with a quick plan on how to break the rock into smaller pieces, how to turn those smaller pieces into sand. Of course there might be ways to directly turn it into sand without going through the smaller pieces. But in order to do that you need to be good if not an expert in coding. I'm not yet in the stage of obtaining smaller pieces of rock. I merely scratch the surface of it to get nanograms of dust. I don't expect to create miracles by learning basic commands of github. But it will help to keep track which tool gave me the highest amount of dust will be a good beginning. 

	Below you'll find examples of scripts I wrote in order to analyze molecular dynamics simulations of ligand-gated ion channels. They are highly biased towards the pentameric ligand gated ion channels, aka cys-loop receptors. With a bit of modification they will be applicable to any system. Feel free to make suggesstions. You are more than welcomed to contribute with your own scripts or make modifications to the scripts on github.
