    "# MEMBRANE PROTEIN SIMULATION: GLIC\n",
    "Setting up membrane protein simulations is trickier than preparing a soluble protein. However the basic needs are the same. Meaning that you need coordinate files (protein and lipid) and the corresponding topologies. Forcefield files and the topology of lipids is provided within the tuturial files you will download below. The tutorial is a bit long. But I wanted to explain the steps to a person who is not familiar with the process at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start lets create a project directory named GLIC_pH70. The protein we are going to use, as the name of the folder states, is called GLIC. GLIC is a pH-gated cationic channel, homologous to cys-loop receptors. pH-gated here means the activation is done by increasing the pH from 7.0 to 4.0. There for we named the folder pH70. After you have gone through this tutorial and enjoyed it, you can try changing the protonation states of some residues and setup another simulation as a practice. Back to business...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now within GLIC_pH70 create the following folders: *prep, run-files, em, equi, prod*. *prep* folder is our working directory to setup the simulation box. *run-files* is the directy we will place the final files. In theory this is just a duplication of the files within *prep* but things gets messy there. So it is a good practice to have a clean copy of the basic files in a seperate folder. *em, equi,* and *prod* folders will contain the minimisation, equilibration and the production runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PREREQUISITES\n",
    "Even if setting up simulations is not your main job, you clearly felt the need to setup a simulation or two that you have ended up going through this page. I strongly recommend getting familiar with the basic terminal commands. If you are an experimentalit, it might be a scary transition. But the tasks are much easier to complete!!! Trust me I have done that transition. There is nothing to fear. Just don't use the remove/move commands with a *. You are more than welcomed to contact me for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also I assume you know the meaning of a simulation. If not, I do not recemmonned starting with membrane proteins. Setting up a membrane protein simulation right away could be frusturating due to extra steps required to prepare. [Justin Lemkul's tutorials](http://www.mdtutorials.com/) are a perfect way to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the real requirements: You should have VMD and GROMACS installed. If you are using terminal (bash) set the variables below and source the gromacs if it is not in your path:"

    "## PREPARE THE COORDINATES AND THE TOPOLOGY \n",
    "\n",
    "Go a head and [download the tutorial files](https://github.com/ozyo/stb_proteinart/blob/master/tutorial/GLIC/GLIC_Tutorial_gmx2016.tar.gz) and extract. Within the extracted folder you will find two forcefield folders. It's better if you don't make modifications to the main gromacs forcefield folder in the beginning. So keep these folders here for now, even tough one of those folder is a duplication of what is already installed. Move them over to the prep folder. Both of them are needed! One is the original amber99sb-ILDN folder. The other one is extended with the lipid parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have provided two coordinate files ending with .pdb. 4NPQ_BA1.pdb is the first biological assembly of the GLIC 4NPQ structure. Crystal structures often contain other molecules than protein or missing residues/atoms. I have cleaned the crystal structure from extra molecules and other biological assemblies. Then used MODELLER to fix the missing backbone&sidechain atoms. There are other ways to fix the structure. But these will not be covered in this tutorial. The second coordinate file contains Berger POPC lipids. It is a bilayer with 332 lipids. This lipid patch is just enough size to accomodate GLIC. Copy both files to prep folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also find a .tcl script and gmembed.mdp, gmembed.dat files. Copy these to the prep folder too. I will explain their job below. There are some limitations when we use bash magic cells. You can run the commands in a terminal or close the notebook, move it to prep folder and open it again. This way you should be able to run the cells directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the real fun begins; load these two structures to your favorite visualization software. You see that these two structures are not aligned. In order to place the protein into the membrane first we need to align them. Our membrane patch expands on the xy plane. That means we need to align the transmembrane domain to its 3rd principal axis, z. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are adventurous you can try to do this manually :-) If you want to a short cut here are some awesome tools from gromacs and a beatiful VMD script.\n",
    "1. First we align the protein on its principal axes and center it at 0 0 0\n",
    "2. Next we rotate it by 90&deg; around the y axis. These steps aligns the protein channel with the z axis. It also enables us to place the transmembrane domain to the bilayer correctly.\n",
    "3. As the last step we move/translate the protein into the bilayer. The .tcl script moves the protein by aligning the the center of the trasmembrane domain to the center of the bilayer."

Adding waters to bilayer systems are a bit tricky, especially with channels. You want water within the channel, but you not within the bilayer. Since there is space within the bilayer, solvation tools fills it with waters. But luckily there are several work arounds to the issue.

    "Next step is to update the topology with the new number of lipids and water molecules. After that we will place ions to our system using ionic strength of 0.1M . When adding ions one can use the box volume, however membrane proteins such as GLIC contain a huge extracellular domain that cuts your solvent area by half, at least. So instead I am using molality to determine the number of ions. We also need to know the charge of the protein so that we can neutralize it. It is important that the system has a neutral charge beucase we are using an alogrithm that makes this assumption when calculation the electrostatic forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would see the charge of the protein when you run pdb2gmx. But if you haven't been paying attention to the terminal output at that step you have no idea, even if you were looking it can be overwhelming. When setting up a new system it is a good practice to examine the printed info from pdb2gmx, not just for system charge but for disulfide bridge formations, protonation states on histidines, number of chains/residues, etc. But don't worry we won't go back. There is a neat way of finding the total system charge with the commands below, you can use them for automating the setup later on."

    "Now we have a coordinate system and a topology file ready. And we are almost done with our preperations. Membrane protein systems might require a bit longer equilibration as we have a heterogeneous system. To prevent protein changing its conformation abruptly during the equilibration, we will place position restraints on all the atoms except the hydrogens. These restraints will then be gradually reduced to only backbone and the Calpha atoms of the proteins. For GMX to apply these restraints we have to create those files. Run the commands below to do just that. "
